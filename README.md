# KNN-Example
K nearest neighbours example

This is a simple example of KNN algorithm to classify unavailable product names from sales data, using their price and other characteristics. I had to do this for my work, where our software vendor has connection problems and we lost this data. The actual dataset is confidential, so I am using a similar one that I created myself.
